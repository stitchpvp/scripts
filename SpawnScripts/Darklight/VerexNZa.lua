Although Hate's Envy was theirs, we quickly took over once Neriak and Darklight were connected. Part of our pact with Freeport involves one of their ambassadors present at all times--but they don't seem to take much interest in the day to day affairs of Hate's Envy. Sselnyl runs the show, that's the bottom line.")
