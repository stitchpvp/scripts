Our city is a lamp in the darkness, and a clarion call to awaken Norrath from its long nightmare of discord.  Let us remember that people in other lands look to us for hope and guidance.  We are Norrath's shining example of what civilization really and truly means.   But we mustn't fall into complacency and self-satisfaction.  There is yet much to be done.  There are refugees beyond our gates who do not enjoy the freedoms and rights we take for granted.  They scratch out their meager lives in hunger and ignorance.  Some flee persecution and violence; others are tormented by the merciless ravages of want.  We Qeynosians who live in abundance are called to reach out to these refugees, to open our hearts and hands.", "", 3038020523, 1696768651)
