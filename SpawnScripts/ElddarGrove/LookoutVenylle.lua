What I do know is a grave bearing her name sits on a hill overlooking the village.  You'll see for yourself; she was laid to rest years ago.")

The village is built around the waterwheel that keeps the aqueduct flowing.  The duct passes through rock so you may lose sight of it for a time.  Just continue around the mountain, and you'll see it on the other side.")
